      At other schools, athletics can be an exclusive pursuit, reserved for the
      elite. And while we pride ourselves on the 56 Conference Championships and
      185 All-Americans we’ve produced, we’re also proud of how many of our
      students don’t just spectate, they participate. Over a third of our
      student body is part of intercollegiate sports, intramurals and clubs.
      Enjoy competition, camaraderie and grow in your sportsmanship at H-SC.
